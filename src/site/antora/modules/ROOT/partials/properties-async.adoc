| [[log4j2.formatMsgAsync]]`log4j2.formatMsgAsync`

(`LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_ASYNC`)
| false
| If `false`, Log4j will make sure the message is formatted in the caller thread, otherwise the formatting will occur on the asynchronous thread.

**Remark**: messages annotated with link:../javadoc/log4j-api/org/apache/logging/log4j/message/AsynchronouslyFormattable[AsynchronouslyFormattable] will be formatted on the async thread regardless of this setting.

| [[log4j2.asyncQueueFullPolicy]]`log4j2.asyncQueueFullPolicy`

(`LOG4J_ASYNC_QUEUE_FULL_POLICY`)
| `Default`
a| Determines the link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/async/AsyncQueueFullPolicy[AsyncQueueFullPolicy] to use when the underlying async component cannot keep up with the logging rate and the queue is filling up.

It accepts the following values:

* `Default`: blocks the calling thread until the event can be added to the queue.

* `Discard`: when the queue is full, it drops the events whose level is equal or less than the threshold level (see <<log4j2.discardThreshold>>).

* the fully qualified class name of a custom implementation

| [[log4j2.discardThreshold]]`log4j2.discardThreshold`

(`LOG4J_DISCARD_THRESHOLD`)
| `INFO`
| Determines the threshold level used by a `Discard` queue full policy.
Log events whose level is equal or less specific than the threshold level will be discarded during a queue full event.
See also <<log4j2.asyncQueueFullPolicy>>.
