    Version-specific release notes (`7.8.0.adoc`, etc.) are generated from `src/changelog/*/.release-notes.adoc.ftl`.
    Auto-generation happens during `generate-sources` phase of Maven.
    Hence, you must always

    1. Find and edit the associated `.release-notes.adoc.ftl`
    2. Run `./mvnw generate-sources`
    3. Commit both `.release-notes.adoc.ftl` and the generated `7.8.0.adoc`

[#release-notes-2-x-x]
== 2.x.x



This release primarily contains bug fixes and minor enhancements.

The Log4j 2.20.1 API, as well as many core components, maintains binary compatibility with previous releases.

Apache Log4j 2.20.1 requires a minimum of Java 11 to build and Java 8 to run.
Log4j 2.12.4 is the last release to support Java 7.
Log4j 2.3.2 is the last release to support Java 6.
Java 6 and Java 7 are no longer supported by the Log4j team.

For complete information on Apache Log4j 2, including instructions on how to submit bug reports, patches, or suggestions for improvement, see http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[the Apache Log4j 2 website].

* Adapted the OSGi metadata of `log4j-api`, `log4j-core`, `log4j-slf4j-impl` and `log4j-slf4j2-impl` to activate the bundle when it is accessed. To achieve that set the `Bundle-ActivationPolicy` to `lazy` for the log4j bundles. (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/issues/1367[1367])
* Avoided using released objects in `StackTraceStringResolver` of `JsonTemplateLayout` (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/1380[1380])

* Fixed concurrent date-time formatting issue in `PatternLayout` (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/issues/1485[1485])
* Fixed runtime dependencies documentation (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/1530[1530])
* Allowed to override FQCN in `Log4jEventBuilder` by implementing `CallerBoundaryAware` (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/1533[1533])
